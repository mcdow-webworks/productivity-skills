## Screenshot Guidelines

### note-taking-demo.png

**Recommended capture:**
- Platform: Claude Desktop (web or app)
- Content: Conversation showing Claude finding related notes automatically
- Format: PNG, 1200-1600px wide recommended
- Theme: Dark mode preferred for professional appearance

**Example interaction to capture:**

1. **Add a note with automatic connection:**
   ```
   You: Note that the authentication refactor is complete using JWT

   Claude: Added to your November notes! I also found your earlier
           authentication discussion from October 12 where you
           decided on this approach.
   ```

2. **Search showing progression:**
   ```
   You: What did I decide about authentication?

   Claude: You have 3 authentication-related entries:

           • Oct 12: Decided to use JWT with refresh tokens
           • Oct 8: Security review concerns noted
           • Nov 16: Implementation complete

           Shows progression from concern → decision → implementation!
   ```

**What to highlight:**
- Natural language interaction
- Automatic connection discovery (the key differentiator)
- Cross-session memory (entries from different times)
- AI understanding of progression/context

**Screenshot tips:**
- Capture 2-3 exchanges to show conversation flow
- Include visible dates/timestamps
- Show enough context but keep it readable
- Crop out browser chrome/unnecessary UI
